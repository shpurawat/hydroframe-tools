Thanks much for Mr. Ahmad Rezaii!

Installation
--------------------
For Python2
```
python setup.py install

```

For Python3
```
python3 setup.py install

``````

Notes:
---------------------
On MacOS you may need to force building with clang instead of gcc.  If you get an error like:
`fatal error: limits.h: No such file or directory`
It is likely due to gcc not finding the correct errors.  The Python setup script uses the CC environment variable for chosing a compiler, you can set it like this (in bash):
```
>export CC=clang
```
or in c-shell
```
>setenv CC clang
```
then 
```
python3 setup.py install
```


Originality
--------------------
Most of the c code *pfio.c* is adapted from [ParFlow](https://github.com/parflow/parflow). Specifically, these codes were used:
+ printdatabox.c
+ readdatabox.c
+ tools_io.c 

Usage
--------------------

To read .pfb file

```
import pfio
data = pfio.pfread(filename)

```

To write a new .pfb file

```
import pfio
pfio.pfwrite(data,filename,X0,Y0,Z0,DX,DY,DZ)
```
